      "Raw LLM Output for review: DO NOT LET THIS LOCATION SERVICE YOUR VEHICLE! I have owned some FORD vehicle over the past 12 years and I will never buy FORD again because of this service center. In just over three months (between July2022-Sept.2022), I received two oil changes from this location. By the following month, my low oil light came flashing on and off for about a week or so. Shortly after, in the span of one drive home from work, my car started billowing thick clouds of white smoke and became unsafe to drive. The two employees, B. and R., tried to coerce me into saying that I added oil more than the engine has capacity for. I did not agree to their intimidation tactic and asked them if they tested the liquid to see if other fluids were present(from leakage of improper sealing) to which R. said, \"I took a picture of the puddle.\" I also asked, if they disassembled the engine to find the root of the problem or if the oil indicator is calibrated? In another conversation I had with a Ford employee I asked why they stopped production of the same model car (Ford EcoSport) after 2022, but they replied my car was not involved in any recall. This was the first issue I’ve had with this new vehicle in the 3 years of leasing it, it was under the 60,000 warranty mileage, and never had a problem at the previous 2 Ford service locations I’ve gone to in the past 2 & 1/2 years leading up to this nightmare experience. For the first two weeks they had my car their communication was scarce, they did not respond to me or my insurance company, they lack basic costumer service & professionalism(one employee refused to give me her name and told me I would have to get my car from the lot even after it was not fixed and I made her aware it was unsafe to drive), Oh and the gentleman that was working on my car/the diagnostics report is no longer employed there! The employee, Bryan, was \"let go\", quit, or fired by the time I took the train there to check on my car the next day. Its been 4 months without my car. Avoid the mistake I made and take your car elsewhere- Avoid the danger, stress, and poor practice of this location.\n",

Then when you did get her on the phone, she said she would check on your question and call you back on Monday.  Well Monday never came as we never received a phone call back.  When I called again I just started speaking with Jane who was very helpful.  Debby also told me that my brakes were metal to metal and that they needed to be replaced with the rotars.  This was false as I just replaced my brakes.  I took the car back to my personal mechanic and the brakes and rotars are perfect.  I have video and pictures to prove this.  Debby charged me $150 diagnostic fee which was not correct.  They didn't even take the tires off to look at the brakes.  I definitely will not be using Ford of Queens again.  They made plenty of money from replacing my transmission.  They didn't need to start adding unneeded repairs and fees.  Very disappointing and not trustworthy.

      "Raw LLM Output for review: This is the most awful service center I ever used. Ever since I bought a preowned vehicle from them it has been haunting my life. After months of buying the car I had to bring it in for a recall. After the recall I can tell it wasn’t driving the same. Made a grinding sound in the back axel that I made them aware of and had them check multiple times. They assured me over and over again there was nothing wrong... fast forward about a year later I bring it in because my mechanic told me the differential is messed up and that my warranty should cover it. I called and tried to set up a time to bring it in. The receptionist told me it’s not covered insisting that I only had a 30k warranty without even looking up my information. I remained persistent and finally she looked it up to tell me I do have a 60k warranty on the power train. I set up the appointment (which was weeks from my call date) and after traveling over an hour away just to find out that the warranty ended literally 5 days ago. I didn’t even know the date the warranty ended because I was not the first owner. But I can’t help but think this was the same grinding sound they told me a year ago was nothing and also can’t help but think they purposely set my appointment date after the warranty ended. I don’t care if they offer me a free car I will never do business with them and I’m seriously contemplating on calling the Better Business Bureau and my local news network to let them know the kind of BS that’s going on in that place. I work very hard and all of this could have been resolved with adequate service.\n",

      "Raw LLM Output for review: Absolutely just the WORST! Brought my car into their service center based on convenience to commuter transportation on Feb. 26th. I requested a loaner vehicle during my appointment setting which at the time of drop off was not available, but that was the least of my problems. Kevin, my car manager, was provided with a full diagnostics with parts needed from a previous Ford servicing center whom I trusted as well as with my extended warranty information. After following up with the service center on multiple occasions, I was told after a TWO WEEK waiting period that my warranty company would need to send an inspector. After contacting my warranty company, I was told by an extremely versed mechanic that the managers at the servicing center were very incompetent, that they only needed a part that cost less than my $250 deductible and only 30 minutes to install. They recommended bringing my car elsewhere for service. Ford Lincoln advised that they already ordered the part and that within just a few days my car would be ready to pick up. A week passes and still my car is not fixed with no communication from them. The part ordered did not work and now we are at square one. Kevin happens to be out of office on the day I'm promised the car would be ready. Livid at this point, I speak with the manager of the servicing center to have my vehicle ready for pickup regardless of it being fully repaired. The manager attempts to resolve the situation by looking into my files and reaching out to the warranty company yet again regarding the new part requested. Again, the (same) part is less than my deductible. Again, the part does not work. The manager than finally confirmed that the part needed was what was on the previous service center's diagnostic which costs more than $1k to repair (part/ service). By now I've wasted a month waiting for a proper diagnostic and repair. I requested to have my vehicle available to pickup immediately! Upon arrival, I am asked to PAY their diagnostic fee and only after threatening to get a lawyer involved did they waive it. What a deplorable and horrible experience for a FORD dealership. Waiting a month for proper diagnostic is unacceptable. Unless you truly have time (and money) to waste, I would suggest bringing your car elsewhere!\n",

When i called Customer service, they  failed to address the issue, and fit me into their schedule. The girl I was speaking with was questioning me as if she was the mechanic and I didn't know what I was talking about. That's not good customer service.  Now I have to wait for a piece that should have been placed on the day of service. Not happy...\n",

      "Raw LLM Output for review: I don’t recommend anyone to use this place. I brought my truck here for them to check why my engine light keeps coming on and my truck shakes while idling, driving. I also asked for an oil change. When I got my truck back the oil was the exact same as I dropped off, yet the mechanic was paid for it. The worst part is that they said my engine was too big for my truck that is why my truck shakes. Smh preposterous reason.....not to mention my engine light came back on same day I picked up from them. Employees don’t want to work but get aid for doing nothing to your vehicle. Disappointing I had to my vehicle somewhere else and they performed a diagnostic test and found the issue with my truck.\n",

      "Raw LLM Output for review: This place sucks. Brought my brand new 2016 transit 3 times for same problem.  First the fan would click on  and stay on even at highway speed's. It never shut off even though the car is not overheating. I brought it in and he change the sensor. This summer same thing happen then went on and stayed on. This time the engine conked out on me and said engine fault. This is very dangerous because it can cause an accident or even death. I brought it in and the guy change the air intake. Still  same problem in the summertime the fan clicks on stays on will not shut off I am not going to wait until the engine conks out on me again so I made an appointment for today which I made online and said it was available. Unfortunately I'm here in the shop is closed they need to redo their website they are wasting peoples precious time when I have an appointment at 8 AM but the shop isn't even open.  This is my third time bring this car in for the same reason. It caused me so much downtime it's disgusting.  And the people are amongst the most rude I have ever meet. Don't bother saying good morning to these people you will not get a response. When I went to go pick up my car for the second time I asked the guy what was wrong with it he completely ignored me and started talking to another worker. Like I did not even exist. Terrible staff. Pretty sure I am going to have to use lemon law on this one.\n",

      "Raw LLM Output for review: When I take my car to my mechanic for a tune up or inspection, I make an appointment a week in advance and on that day I am at the shop at 7am. I usually hear from them around 4pm with the results. This is how it works. I know that. However I needed a FORD mechanic to fix my sunroof so I made an appointment telling the receptionist of the specific problem. If I had known that FORD of QUEENS worked on a first come first served basis I would have brought my car in at 7am as well. But, since I had an 11am appointment that I made a week in advance I was surprised to be put at the end of the \"Walk In\" line and was told my car wouldn't even be looked at until 4pm at the earliest.  As a customer that respectfully made an appointment I was prepared to wait 2-3 hours. But to be told I should leave the premises because it would be 5 hours before my car was even looked at was frustrating. I wish they would have either respected my time as well and honored my appointment or be clear on the phone that their daily service is on a first come first serve basis.\n",

I requested my car to be done by 12pm due to an engagement I had. When I called at 12pm, I was sent to a VM, I left a message for a rep. I gave me approximately an hour to respond and no one did. I then called again and a rep informed me that my car had not yet been serviced and stated I would receive a call back. The previous day I had informed that I needed a shuttle and one was not offered to me, for pick up. I received a call back and was informed that I needed to be there by 3 pm or I could go through the sales side and pick up my car after 3pm. I had to look for a ride there, and when I got there the sales team were like deer in headlights and were unaware that I would be picking up my car. My car key could not be located at first. When it was located I inquired about using my ford points to pay and the rep informed “that he did not have access”. Note, I have paid with my ford points in the past without any issue. And to top it off I then received a coupon in the mail the next day for the oil change. It’s apparent that things have changed at this site.  I will not be returning.\n",

That was amazing and informative. Mike was knowledgeable and very helpful and never treated me less than because I'm a woman. He answered all my questions with a smile on his face.

      "Raw LLM Output for review: This isn't a bad review on the business or the service person handling my concern.  This is more an issue with Ford.  To give a little bit of context, I bought my 2017 Ford Focus Titanium brand new and took out a premiem warranty at time of purchase.  The car has essentially all options with it including a sunroof. Past 4.5 years I've put 61000 miles on the car.  Started to notice a rattling on the driver side ceiling  liner  by the sunroof which is seldomly used.  Brought in to Bethlehem Ford and was advised it would be looked at.  Towards the end of the day received a phone call that they were still looking at what could be done, but this item wasn't covered under warranty and would probably run 300-500 bucks, nice warranty.  The next day called back from the service advisor who advised the whole liner would need to be replaced on my 61000 mile car and it would be $2700.  Still kind of floored and wondering what other issues the vehicle may have in the future if I keep it.  Did call the dealership twice after they responded to my review spoke to the secretary/operator who connected me to a voicemail that I left messages on and never received a call back.\n",

      "Raw LLM Output for review: Was having issues with my f150. Now I'm mechanically inclined, I also have a diagnostic tool for my truck. I told service rep I was having a P0017 code which is a crankshaft sensor issue and the advancetrac light came on. I was also getting high oil pressure and my truck would go limp. (This happened after an oil change) So I took it to ford because I didn't want to deal with it. After they ran diagnostic (which I already did but i get it, its procedural). After which they told me it would be $5000 for a new engine harness and that MAY fix the issue. I declined ofcourse took it home. Did some searching on the internet and found that the issue of going limp can be from a faulty filter or oil pressure switch. I purchased both parts for less than $30. I removed the intake assembly and chanrge pipes for driver side turbo. Pulled the pressure switch out using a 13/16 wrench and replaced it. Reassembled air intake and turbo pipes. Did a full oil change with high performance Fram filter. Then drove to New Jersey and back no issues with oil pressure and going limp. I was pushing the truck because I wanted to see if I could replicate the oil pressure issue and it didn't happen. So now I'm back to square 1 with advance trac and crankshaft sensor lights. The abs module was not looked at, the wheel speed sensor was not looked at, the crankshaft sensor was not looked at, etc. However they charged me $200, I would love to have my money back. Seems like after they found out I was paying out of pocket and it wasnt covered under warranty they didn't want to really look at it. I guess ill just take it to a mom and pop shop and have the crankshaft sensor replaced. Again i could do it myself but I have a degree for havac and im a commercial HVACR tech, so i dont have the time. You would think ford techs would be the best well... i got another thing for you. Waste of time and money. By the length of this article here that I'm writing you can tell how infuriated I am.\n",

As I have said before, I came in at 9:15 and was able to check my car in but it wasn’t seen until 12:12. If they want to run a dealership they need to understand the logistics of things and not overbook AND understaff every time. They say that they’re understaffed in servicemen yet have so many assistants around not doing anything and wasting time.

So I had to do her job. Once it was identified they contact the warranty company but never scheduled an appointment for them to come an approve the work. I called Gilda she tells me everything is set that they are waiting for the adjuster to come and when I call the warranty company once again I am told they have not received any call from the service department or Gilda it is now almost going on 2 weeks and all I keep getting is the run around.
